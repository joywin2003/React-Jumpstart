Project 1: Ninja ID
This is a simple Flutter project that I created while following along with The Net Ninja's Flutter tutorial series on YouTube. The project is a basic Ninja ID app that displays a user's name, level, email, and profile picture.

This Flutter project displays a list of awesome quotes and allows the user to delete them as needed. It was created while watching the Net Ninja Flutter tutorial series.
